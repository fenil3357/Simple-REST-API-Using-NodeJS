# Simple-REST-API-Using-NodeJS

This is a simple REST API made using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB which can perform CRUD Opertion on data. It stores data in mongoDB cloud Atlas.

In this API I've used mongoDB cloud database (mLab) so if you want to use it you have to write your mongoDB account details as connection string in coustomer_models file (inside mongoose.connet(``)).

You can get your connection string by making an account on mongodb atlas
